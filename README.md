# Binary

Now it was time for me to practice my Grid System knowledge.

At the beginning it seemed quite easy to reproduce this layout, but as I kept going some challenges started to appear. It took me more time than I though it would require me, but at the end it was for the best 'cause I was forced to rebuild my structure one times or two and it made me really get what was happening under the hood using grid system.

Such a nice way to build layouts, I really enjoyed it.

The original layout WAS NOT made by me. I only chose one that would challenge me searching on the internet, since my goal was to practice building a layout using Grid and not to actually design one from scratch.

Since I was so immersed in this practice, I thought it would be nice if we could swap the image and text order as wanted without messing up with the color scheme, so I did it.

I also added some JS so that we could add as many articles as we want and the navigation would still work as it is supposed to. The anchor links are added by JS. It has a loop that checks how many articles there is and it gives the reference links to the proper navigation button.

And finally I also added some 'Back to top' navigation button, so that we could simply go back to top without having to scroll it all the way through.
